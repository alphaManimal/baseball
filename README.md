# BASEBALL!

A flask project for data mashups, visualizations, and analytics focused on baseball. 

I suggest you set up a virtual environment inside this project. I have it in a directory called flask. Download virtualenv.py to this project directory then do:
```
  $ python virtualenv.py flask
```
then you can do:
```
  $ flask/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to make sure we run the same environment.
